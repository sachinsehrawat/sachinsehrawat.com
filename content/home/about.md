Thank you for visiting my website

I'm Sachin Sehrawat and I am working as a Test Analyst at  <a href="https://tsys.com" target="_blank">TSYS</a> since the last 3 years. I hold a strong experience and knowledge in banking and financial domain. If you are visiting my website for any kind of professional or work related matter  I would love to connect with you and I can be contacted here on my <a href="mailto:sachinsehrawat92@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>.
<p>I love my work and what excites me the most about it is the fact that technology is shaping at such a fast pace that we see so many awesome products in the market. I have a keen interest in FinTech and I always try to engage myself to get involved in this field by keeping myself updated via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachin-sehrawat-5647a26b/" target="_blank">linkedin</a>. It doesn't matter how busy I am with work but I always manage to keep 2 hours free for myself every single day to learn something new. Be it learning to code, diving into automation of random stuff, reading about new tools in the market or making a cool website like this.</p>
<p>Whenever I get time from my work and learning, you will find me traveling somewhere. There was a time when I was that guy who was only into his work but then at the lowest point of my life I was sent on-site to Jamaica because of which I got influenced tp travel more. Hence, I started traveling to different places to explore and have, as a result, met a lot of awesome people. I believe there are some things which can only be experienced and not learnt. I have a lot of stories to share from my travel experiences. I have been writing blogs on my travel experiences since Jan 2018 and If you are interested to give it a read, check them out <a href="https://pennytraveller.quora.com/" target="_blank">blogs</a>. </p>
<p> Feel free to get in touch via email or any other social media platform.
