Thank you for visiting my website

I'm Sachin Sehrawat and I am working as a Test Analyst at  <a href="https://tsys.com" target="_blank">TSYS</a> from 3 years. I hold a strong experience knowledge in Banking and Financial domain. If you are visiting my website for any professional or work related matter  I would love to connect with you and I can be contacted on my here on my <a href="mailto:sachinsehrawat92@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>.
<p>I love my work and what excites me more about is the technology is shaping at such a fast pace and I see there are so many awesome products in the market. I have a keen interest in FinTech and I always engage myself to get involved in this field by keeping myself updated on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sachin-sehrawat-5647a26b/" target="_blank">linkedin</a>. Doesn't matter how busy I am with work but I always keep 2 hours free for myself daily to learn something new starting from learning coding , automation, latest tools or make a cool website like this.</p>
<p>When I get time from work and my self learning I find myself traveling somewhere. There was a time when I was busy with work, work and work but then I started traveling to different places and meet a lot of awesome people. I believe there are few things which cant be learned and can only be experienced. I have a lot of stories to share from my travel experiences. I had started writing blogs on my travel experience since Jan 2018 and If you are interested to give it a read, check out my <a href="https://pennytraveller.quora.com/" target="_blank">blogs</a>. </p>
<p> Feel free to get in touch via email or any of the social media platform.
